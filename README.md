# StyleCLIP-FaceApp

Open the file ['StyleCLIP-Global'](https://github.com/SabbyDude/StyleCLIP-FaceApp/blob/main/StyleCLIP_global.ipynb) in an supported interactive python notebook environment, preferably [Google Colab](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwibieXE7_3yAhXg7XMBHZc0A0MQFnoECAIQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcolab.research.google.com%2Fnotebooks%2F&usg=AOvVaw0eDNVclINNdlOuD-YTYiiB)

Make a copy of the file in Google Colab before you start working just in case you mess up the file, you'll be able to start fresh by making a copy of original file once again.

Performing the task is very simple, all the steps are mentioned in the file and cell already.

If you want to work on a specified image you need to upload it in the environment/repo and provide it's location, when required, correctly or it will throw an error, you can use the default images provided or get a generated image from the model as well.

A high definition version of the ouput image will also be provided.
